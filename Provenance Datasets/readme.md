# About the datasets

Datasets were collected using three tools by [Battle and Heer](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2019-CharacterizingEVA-EuroVis.pdf), [Liu and Heer](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/latency/) and [Wall](https://emilywall.github.io/media/papers/Thesis.pdf).

* [Battle and Heer](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2019-CharacterizingEVA-EuroVis.pdf) collected interaction logs of 27 users performing exploratory analysis of three datasets: flight performance, wildlife strikes and weather using the Tableau data visualization and analytics tool.
* [Liu and Heer](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/latency/) collected interaction logs of 16 users performing interactive visual exploration on large datasets like user check-ins on Brightkite and flight delays datasets using the imMens system.
* [Wall](https://emilywall.github.io/media/papers/Thesis.pdf) collected interaction logs of 24 users who use an interactive scatterplot-based visualization system to select a committee of politicians.

Liu and Heer and Wall interaction log datasets are only shared for review purposes, and the original authors should be contacted if the dataset would want to be used in the future for another project.

The statistics_of_datasets.py file provides different statistics like number of participants, mean, median and mode number of interaction logs for the participants in each of the three interaction log datasets.
